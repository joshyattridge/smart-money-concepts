# Smart Money Concepts (smc) BETA

The Smart Money Concepts Python Indicator is a sophisticated financial tool developed for traders and investors to gain insights into market sentiment, trends, and potential reversals. This indicator is built using Python, a versatile programming language known for its data analysis and visualization capabilities.

## Installation

```bash
pip install smartmoneyconcepts
```

## Usage

```python
from smartmoneyconcepts import smc
```

Prepare data to use with smc:

smc expects properly formated ohlc DataFrame, with column names in lowercase: ["open", "high", "low", "close"] and ["volume"] for indicators that expect ohlcv input.

## Indicators

FVG - Fair Value Gap
Highs and Lows
OB - Order Block
Liquidity

## Examples

Please take a look at smc.test.py for more detailed examples on how each indicator works.

```python
    smc.fvg(ohlc) # Fair Value Gap
    smc.highs_lows(ohlc, up_thresh=0.05, down_thresh=-0.05) # Highs and Lows
    smc.ob(ohlc) # Order Block
    smc.liquidity(ohlc, range_percent=0.01, up_thresh=0.05, down_thresh=-0.05) # Liquidity
```
